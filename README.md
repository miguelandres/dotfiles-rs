Dotfiles-rs is an automation framework that can be used for dotfiles configuration.
I have taken a lot of *ahem* inspiration *cough* from
[`anishathalye/dotbot`](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot). This is a
rewrite of `dotbot` to teach myself rust, and also because I find python
annoying when trying to extend `dotbot` via plugins

I have plans to extend what `dotbot` does natively, and I will find some time to
write a roadmap soon, I hope.

For now, the documentation is sparse and it's still not usable, bear with me.
