# rustybot

Rustybot is an automation framework that can be used for dotfiles configuration.
I have taken a lot of *ahem* inspiration *cough* from
`[anishathalye/dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)`. This is a rewrite of
`dotbot` to teach myself rust, and also because I find python annoying when trying
to extend `dotbot` via plugins

I have plans to extend what `dotbot` does natively, and I will find some time to 
write a roadmap soon, I hope.

For now, the documentation is sparse and it's still not usable, bear with me.
